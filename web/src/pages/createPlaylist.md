# Create Playlist
[createPlaylist.js](./createPlaylist.js) is a [JavaScript module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that handles the logic for the "create playlist" page of a website. It uses various classes and utility modules to interact with the website's API, manage data, and handle user interactions. Let's break down the code step by step:

## 1. Import Statements:
```javascript
import MusicPlaylistClient from '../api/musicPlaylistClient';
import Header from '../components/header';
import BindingClass from '../util/bindingClass';
import DataStore from '../util/DataStore';
```
The code begins by [importing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_features_into_your_script) four modules:

- `MusicPlaylistClient`: It is an API client used to interact with the backend playlist API.
- `Header`: Is a [component](https://dev.to/xavortm/what-are-components-in-the-front-end-and-why-do-we-need-them-2o2p) that adds a header to the webpage.
- `BindingClass`: This class provides utility methods for binding class methods to the class instance. It helps in handling `this` context issues in JavaScript. (Binding of `this` is an advanced Javascript concept)
- `DataStore`: This is a utility module that stores data from our API and serves as a intermediary between the API and what is rendered to the page.

## 2. CreatePlaylist Class:
```javascript
class CreatePlaylist extends BindingClass {
    // Constructor
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.bindClassMethods(['mount', 'submit', 'redirectToViewPlaylist'], this);
        this.dataStore = new DataStore();
        this.dataStore.addChangeListener(this.redirectToViewPlaylist);
        this.header = new Header(this.dataStore);
    }

    // Mount method to initialize the page
    mount() {
        document.getElementById('create').addEventListener('click', this.submit);
        this.header.addHeaderToPage();
        this.client = new MusicPlaylistClient();
    }

    // Method to handle submit button click
    async submit(evt) {
        // ...
    }

    // Method to redirect to the playlist view page
    redirectToViewPlaylist() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The `CreatePlaylist` class is defined, extending `BindingClass` to utilize its method binding functionality. It has three methods:

- `constructor`: Initializes the class, binds relevant methods, and creates instances of `DataStore` and `Header`. The `addChangeListener` method ensures that whenever the playlist is updated in the data store, the `redirectToViewPlaylist` method will be called to redirect the user to the view playlist page.

- `mount`: This method is called when the page loads and sets up event listeners. Specifically, it adds an event listener to the element with ID `'create'` button to trigger the `submit` method when clicked. It also adds the header to the page and creates an instance of the `MusicPlaylistClient`.

- `submit`: This is an [asynchronous](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/asynchronous-programming-in-javascript#conclusion) method that is called when the "create playlist" submit button is pressed. It handles form data (playlist name and tags), displays loading indicators, and uses the `MusicPlaylistClient` to create the playlist. If there is an error, it displays the error message.

- `redirectToViewPlaylist`: This method is called when the playlist is updated in the data store. It retrieves the playlist's ID and redirects the user to the view playlist page by changing the window's location.

## 3. Main Function:
```javascript
const main = async () => {
    const createPlaylist = new CreatePlaylist();
    createPlaylist.mount();
};

window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main);
```
This code defines a main function  (think of this as the javascript equivalent of the [main function in java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-main-method-public-static-void-main-string-args/)) that creates an instance of the `CreatePlaylist` class and calls its `mount` method when the DOM content has loaded (i.e., the webpage has finished loading).
 
In summary, this JavaScript module sets up the "create playlist" page with event listeners and API interactions. It uses classes and utility modules to handle data management, API calls, and page rendering.
